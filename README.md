The paper presents an efficient dynamic slicing technique for Java programs using compressed bytecode traces with the RLESe algorithm. RLESe transforms bytecode trace analysis into an efficient, memory-friendly process, enabling faster debugging and enhanced dynamic slicing with omission error detection.
